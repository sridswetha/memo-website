    content: `Are you stressed about upcoming due dates and exams? Struggling with not getting enough sleep, experiencing anxiety, or even feeling burnt out? You are not alone. As of late,  many college students have been experiencing mental health-related difficulties. According to a 2020 review conducted by Dr. Kang and his colleagues, there has been an alarming rate of mental health disorders among undergraduate students [1]. They found that 19% to 48% of students have eating disorders, 22% have depression, and 9.4% to 36% have sleep disorders [1]. These may seem like numbers to you, but behind every number is a classmate, friend, or coworker who is struggling to manage all the responsibilities of being a student in this modern world. These numbers help college officials recognize the need for mental health services and plan to provide them for their students. However, we are facing major budget cuts on research initiatives that not only help us recognize the need for services, but also initiatives that aim to create new therapies, medications, or programs.

The various services that the University of Maryland (UMD) offers, including the on-site psychiatrist, medication management, and peer-led workshops, did not appear out of nowhere. These services were established in response to the school's research, which revealed an increased need for them. In fact, in 2022, UMD formed a task force dedicated to determining the need for mental health support services among staff and students [2]. Moreover, the UMD counseling center conducts an annual report to provide comprehensive statistics and findings about its achievements and the research unit’s findings. UMD’s ability to provide its services is also dependent on research, since scientists are behind each method, conducting tests and inspections to ensure they are effective and efficient. Without the allocated funds, the progress toward new interventions and methods is slowed down, leaving the students with a limited number of options to seek help from and longer wait times. Over time, students can face many detrimental implications for many staff members, students, and families, such as higher dropout rates due to burnout and stress, health costs, and loss of motivation.

Budget cuts don’t just affect large institutions like UMD or the NIH; the impact goes deeper than that. With fewer projects funded by the government, there are even fewer opportunities for students to get involved in research labs. Gaining experience as a student is an important part of modern academia, and with the growing rates of people seeking a higher education [3], opportunities to gain experience are in high demand. This is even more harmful for students working towards careers in medicine, psychology, or public health.

	Unfortunately, it is going to take more than just the public’s attention to help resolve this issue. However, there are things you could be doing right now to fight against the consequences of budget cuts to mental health research. Firstly, stay informed about the current events surrounding research funding and how it impacts you. Second, make sure to speak up when you have the chance; this could look like voting, signing petitions, or even just spreading the news. Lastly, join groups like UMD MEMO and NAMI, whose goal is to raise awareness of resources and reduce the stigma around mental health.

    content: `Mama, how am I supposed to tell you 
What plagues my mind day in and out,
When you look at me with such sad eyes?
I know you’re trying your best. Trying to understand
I know this is new for you. Or maybe it isn’t. 
Maybe you’ve felt the same as me, 
But there wasn’t a name for it.

Mama, you blessed me with the gift of life, 
So how do I tell you that I feel it withering away? 
Your arms are open, ready for me to quietly cry in.
It’s one thing if my tears fall, but it’s far worse to see yours.
Mama, have you cried these same tears, too? 
How did you make the tears stop? 

Mama, don’t you know that I want to live? 
Of course I do. I always did. But when I don’t know how, 
What am I supposed to do? 
When despair is all-consuming, what am I supposed to do? 
When hope is fleeting, what am I supposed to do? 
What did you do?



Mama, I know you can’t tell me. I know there’s no single answer.
Even if it came from you, this life is mine alone. 
But I hate being alone. I really do. 
Though, your presence is there. Are my sad eyes
The same as yours? You can’t catch me as I fall,
But you’re there to hold me as I go

I don’t know how long I’ll fall
I don’t know how long I’ll be low
And I certainly don’t know when or how
To get back up, or if I have the strength to

But if you are here right now, Then you’ve fallen too,
And you have laid there low. I wonder for how long.
What lingers for you? What pains you?
I wonder if it’s the same for me.

Mama, what consumes my mind, I bet it’s 
consumed yours too,
But thank you, because at least your arms 
Are open for me. 
Maybe they’re open because 
You've felt this way too, 
But there just wasn’t a name for it.`, // For art pieces, this would be the path to the artwork,

    content: `I was born with the same brown eyes as my mothers. Not hazel, but the kind of brown that met sunlight at its door and would warm a room. The thing about my eyes is they were trusted. Like a secret, they would sometimes reveal a part of myself otherwise kept a mystery. But they also commanded attention. They were wide and big. As my mother would describe them, they were her “beautiful, brown eyes.” Anyone could feel their glare, and it might have frightened them. I did not mind for a while. 

A college class made me look differently, to respond in a way my eyes could not. 

Where I grew up, I found myself surrounded by words most people understood, in an environment that allowed me to believe my voice was potent, perhaps stronger than others. But in this new place, my home away from home, I was challenged by strangers who were making academic successes I could not fathom, who were walking to class smiling from ear to ear. It was like a poison in my blood. And while I found myself feeling a sort of contempt for this new life, I began to go blind. 

Each tree, person, and building showing echoes of itself, proving time and time again to be a lesser version.

But why do my eyes lie? 

They leave me stranded at this puny desk, deserted from others. And it only made me lose more of my senses, in the sense that I did not understand how to use them anymore. My mouth shut close, and my ears folded in on themselves. My teachers would call on me, and my head stayed facing my knees so as to never meet their gaze. 

Was this to be my life? 

My head stuck to my chest, ears closed, and my eyes always facing the ground. After a while, I went home. I still could not see. My mother came up to me and put her hand to my chin. Her warm compression pressed against mine as if she felt something I couldn’t. She’d lift my head towards her so that I may meet her properly and with a dignity kind enough for a mother's love. I began to notice her freckles and her deep smile lines falling from the sides of her nose. And her beauty mark, which kissed her left cheek and her long lashes and the way her lip would move when she’d speak. For a second, I looked at her and saw something unclear. It was illusive but present and real. Intangible, but felt like a breeze or a candle’s light. I met her eyes with mine, and in a blissful silence, she told me the same three words she had told me my entire life. 

So I went to class and raised my hand to speak. In my head thinking, if I keep my eyes open, they could not lie to me again.`,

    content: `There was once a mood in workplaces across the country that remote and hybrid work would rapidly expand and give workers unprecedented flexibility in their lives. As our current generation approaches the workforce, we have seen the conversation shift from “9 to 5s,” to hybrid weeks, and now it shifts back to full return-to-office mandates. Where wellbeing and dynamic schedules were once prioritized, it seems the new era of work is defined by agencies scrutinizing flexible schedules and mental health. 

As someone who has worked closely with families with young children, I’ve heard countless anecdotes of remote work enabling dual-income households and parents to pursue their career goals instead of stepping down to free up time. Workers across the country dialed into their careers each day, making lunch for their children on summer days, or picking them up from school promptly at 3:15 PM in the fall. Unfortunately, what once seemed like a revolution in workplace culture is quickly appearing to be a forward-thinking, but ill-fated policy, targeted for the very flexibility it provided people.

No organization has been more influential in the destruction of remote work in our region than the federal government. One of the first actions President Donald Trump took was to force a return-to-office, which is infamously known in federal worker circles as the “RTO mandate”. For thousands of workers in the District of Columbia and surrounding communities, this meant the end of new normals that allowed families to operate in ways previously impossible. There has already been a noticeable uptick in unemployment in the area. 

The premises of the RTO assume that people are less productive at home than they would be in the office. Often, these criticisms lack nuance, as staff turnover and burnout arise from long commutes and a lack of flexibility. Many people relocated to areas more distant from the traditional D.C. suburbs, including communities in Frederick County and the West Virginia panhandle. For these families, the distance lent itself to more affordability and a slower pace of life, with the proximity to meet in their downtown offices on occasion. Remote work has also had a revitalizing effect on many communities that were previously out of range for big-city dollars. The new lives people were able to pursue under remote work and hybrid models finally allowed workers to choose their own priorities more than ever before.

While studies are underway to see how much remote work affectsaffected productivity, the sudden dissolution of novel ways to work has not only reduced the freedom of workers to build their schedules around their lives, but also has disrupted families who created a life under remote work rules. For now, it seems that people will again have to build their lives around their work schedules, and the mental health advantages from slashing down commute time and allowing more engagement within the home are all but ignored in current policy. 

What kind of system do you hope is in place for your next job?`,

  Torn Between. (2023)

Gouache, acrylic paint, yarn on canvas. Watercolor paint, ink on watercolor paper.

The divisive psychology of first-generation and second-generation immigration. Being surrounded by both cultures at all fronts leaves a disconnection from the motherland that we have never been to. The stories told were often misconstrued by our American perception of our own countries, yet the first-generation immigrants had the privilege of never falling for its propaganda—yet. The painting is a reflection of the second-generation immigrant as a child, unsure about their own culture as they yearn for their mother's culture yet seemingly separated by a fine line, to only witness what America has to offer.
